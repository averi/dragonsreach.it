I&#8217;m an Italian [Red Hatter][1] who lives in [Udine][2], a city in the north-east part of Italy. While my primary education field has been Law, my passion and dedication for the FOSS world have brought me to volunteer and keep up many activities for [GNOME][3] and [Fedora][4] for several years.

### What I am doing now:

  * GNOME: 
      * Being the GNOME [Infrastructure Team][5] Coordinator and leading the [Accounts Team][6].
      * Being the GNOME Foundation [Membership Committee][7]&#8216;s Chairman.
  * Fedora: 
      * Maintaining a set of RPM packages for the Fedora / EPEL repositories

### What I have done in the past:

  * Designed the old Edubuntu&#8217;s Homepage for the Ubuntu Italian LoCo Team as reported on my [announcement][10] on the Ubuntu-it&#8217;s forums.
  * Wrote several Wiki pages and their translations for the Ubuntu [international][11] and [italian][12] communities.
  * Have been an Ubuntu [Developer][13] uploading several packages into the main and universe repositories, full list available at my Launchpad [ID][14].
  * Sponsored and cleaned up the Ubuntu&#8217;s universe queue within the [Ubuntu Sponsors Team][15].
  * Have helped out the awesome [Insight Team][16] setting up a working Drupal [website][17] meant to publish and share news and articles related to Fedora.
  * Been an [AM][18] and helped out new contributors to go through the [NM][19] process and hopefully welcome them as Debian Developers.
  * Have been a Debian Developer and working on my Debian packages available at my [QA Page][20].
  * Was the secretary of the GNOME Foundation [Board of Directors][21] for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 terms.
  * Have been a proud member of the Fedora [Infrastructure Team][8].
