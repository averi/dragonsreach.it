I&#8217;m an Italian [Red Hatter][1] who lives in New York City. While my primary education field has been Law, my passion and dedication for the FOSS world have brought me to volunteer and keep up many activities for [GNOME][3] and [Fedora][4] for several years.

### What I am doing now:

  * GNOME: 
      * Being the GNOME [Infrastructure Team][5] Coordinator
      * Being the GNOME Foundation [Membership Committee][7]&#8216;s Chairman.

### What I have done in the past:

  * Maintained a [set of RPM packages][37] for the Fedora / EPEL repositories
  * Designed the old Edubuntu's Homepage for the Ubuntu Italian LoCo Team as reported on my [announcement][10] on the Ubuntu-it's forums.
  * Wrote several Wiki pages and their translations for the Ubuntu [international][11] and [italian][12] communities.
  * Have been an Ubuntu [Developer][13] uploading several packages into the main and universe repositories, full list available at my Launchpad [ID][14].
  * Sponsored and cleaned up the Ubuntu's universe queue within the [Ubuntu Sponsors Team][15].
  * Have helped out the awesome [Insight Team][16] setting up a working Drupal website meant to publish and share news and articles related to Fedora.
  * Been an Application Manager (AM) and helped out new contributors to go through the [NM][19] process and hopefully welcome them as Debian Developers.
  * Have been a Debian Developer and working on my Debian packages available at my [QA Page][20].
  * Was the secretary of the GNOME Foundation [Board of Directors][21] for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 terms.
  * Have been a proud member of the Fedora [Infrastructure Team][8].

### Random bits:

  * My Ubuntu MOTU interview is available at this [link][22].
  * A brief summary of my Accounts Team work can be found browsing Paul Cutler's [Blog][24].
  * Some material from my candidacy for the Fedora Board: Election's [Questionnaire][26], Town Hall's meeting [log][27] and my [nomination][28].
  * I made the [news][29] at GNOME.org
  * My interview for World Trademark Review about the GNOME trademark dispute with Groupon is available [here][30] (requires registration).
  * My Bachelor degree thesis having "**<span class="il">Legal</span> profiles of <span class="il">the </span><span class="il">GNOME</span> Desktop Environment: from source code's freedom to users' participation in the community**" as its title can be consulted [here][31]. (italian only)
